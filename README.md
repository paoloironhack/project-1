## Project Description
This project will generate a Strong password following a set of pre-defined rules (or maybe user dependent???)

## Rules
A passowrd to be considered strong consists of a string of at least 15 Characters that meet the following conditions:
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Symbols

A strong password should **not** contain/be:
- Your username
- Your name, your friend’s name, your family member’s name, or a common name
- Your date of birth
- Dictionary word
- Be one of your previous passwords
- Not a keyboard pattern

## Workflow

!!! INSERT LINK FOR WORKFLOW !!!

## Organization
To organize my work I created a kanban board and split the work that need to be done into mulitple Tasks. 
Link to Kanban board can be found bellow in the Links Section.

#### Repository structure:
```
└── project-1
    ├── app
    │   ├── functions.py
    │   ├── history.txt (not uploaded to repository. Excluded via .gitignore)
    │   └── main.py
    └── README.md
```

functions.py - contains all the necessary functions to the execution of the program.

main.py - main program file.

history.txt - Contains the password history off all the generated passwords (MD5) in order to prevent double passwords.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
